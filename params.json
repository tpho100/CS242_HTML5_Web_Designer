{"name":"Website Designer","tagline":"Final project submission for CS 242 - Advanced Programming Concepts in Java","body":"# Template-driven Website Designer\r\n\r\nThis repository is for a template-driven website designer written as a JavaFX desktop application. This project started in the Fall of 2015 at Clarkson University as a final project for CS 242 Advanced Programming Concepts in Java. The idea is that a user can create a website using HTML5/CSS without any coding or web design experience. The templates are essentially CSS style sheets pre-made for this application. All the user has to do is add content through an HTML file. The HTML creator is done entirely through a GUI. The application exports a folder with the appropriate CSS, HTML, and any image files. \r\n\r\n# Project Contributors\r\n* David Mosto - Team Lead & HTML5 Generator Engine\r\n* Thanh-Phong Ho - GUI Design & MVC Framework\r\n* James Dapp - Template Creator & Project Integrator\r\n* Oumar Ly - Template Creator","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
